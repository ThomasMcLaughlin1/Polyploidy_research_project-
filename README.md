# Polyploidy Research Project
This repository contains a collection of scripts and templates for analyzing protein sequences and structures in the context of polyploidy research. Tools include workflows for structure prediction, sequence alignment, docking, mutation mapping, and consensus sequence generation.

AlphaFold Script Template 
Template for running AlphaFold to predict protein structures.

MAFFT Alignment Script 
Automates multiple sequence alignments with MAFFT for comparative genomics and phylogenetic analyses.

HADDOCK3 Docking Script 
Workflow for proteinâ€“protein docking simulations using HADDOCK3.

PyMOL Mutation Mapping Scripts
Maps and visualizes mutations onto 3D protein structures in PyMOL.

Multiallelic Consensus Sequence Generator 
Creates consensus sequences that account for multiallelic variation using AF values
